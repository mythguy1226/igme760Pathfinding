# IGME-760 AI Pathfinding HW Assignment
This repository contains the code and assets used for my HW 2 submission for IGME-760.<br>
In this project the player can freely move around the level by clicking on any walkable <br>
terrain. The red target serves as a marker for the player to know where they are able to walk.<br>
The player also has a companion bird that flies in the same target direction as the player and stays closeby.<br>
While navigating the level, each character utilizes the A* algorithm for finding the shortest path and avoiding obstacles.
